# VoiceMonkey Screenshot Guide

This directory should contain screenshots of your VoiceMonkey dashboard for the setup guide.

## Required Screenshots

Add the following screenshots to this directory:

1. **voicemonkey-on-trigger.png**

   - Screenshot showing the creation of an ON trigger in VoiceMonkey
   - Example: "Living Room Lights ON" trigger configuration
   - Should show the trigger name and setup interface

2. **voicemonkey-off-trigger.png**
   - Screenshot showing the creation of an OFF trigger in VoiceMonkey
   - Example: "Living Room Lights OFF" trigger configuration
   - Should show the trigger name and setup interface

## How to Capture Screenshots

1. Log into your [VoiceMonkey.io](https://voicemonkey.io/) dashboard
2. Navigate to the trigger creation/configuration page
3. Take screenshots showing:
   - The trigger name field with the naming convention (e.g., "Living Room Lights ON")
   - The configuration interface
   - Any relevant settings

## Tips for Good Screenshots

- Use a clean, uncluttered view
- Make sure the trigger name is clearly visible
- Crop to show only relevant parts of the interface
- Use PNG format for best quality
- Consider adding annotations or arrows to highlight important fields

Once you add these screenshots, they will automatically appear in the main README.md setup guide!
